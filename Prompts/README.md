# AI Prompts

My AI LLM prompts have been moved to my [scripts repository](https://github.com/grantcarthew/scripts).

This fast paced field needs constant changes.

This is a change to help me automate my use of AI CLI tools and Bash scripts.

## AI Prompts Collection

Within my [scripts repository](https://github.com/grantcarthew/scripts) you will find the [`ai/`](https://github.com/grantcarthew/scripts/tree/main/ai) directory, which contains a comprehensive collection of AI prompts, roles, and templates:

- **[AI Roles](https://github.com/grantcarthew/scripts/tree/main/ai/roles)**: Domain-specific expert personas for cloud, development, and analysis
- **[Commands](https://github.com/grantcarthew/scripts/tree/main/ai/commands)**: Quick task-oriented prompts for immediate use
- **[Metaprompts](https://github.com/grantcarthew/scripts/tree/main/ai/metaprompts)**: Advanced templates for creating other prompts
- **[Templates](https://github.com/grantcarthew/scripts/tree/main/ai/templates)**: Customizable frameworks for resumes and cover letters
