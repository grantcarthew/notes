### General Principle of Merging in GitLab CI/CD: "Last-In Wins"

Reference documents:

- https://docs.gitlab.com/ci/yaml/
- https://docs.gitlab.com/ci/yaml/includes/

The core and most crucial principle governing how GitLab CI/CD merges configurations from multiple `.gitlab-ci.yml` files (when using `include`) is **"Last-In Wins."** This means that when the same key or property is defined in multiple files, the definition from the file that is processed **last** will take precedence and effectively override any earlier definitions.

This principle applies consistently across different data structures:

* **Scalar Values (strings, numbers, booleans):** If a top-level key holds a simple value, the last definition entirely replaces previous ones.
* **Arrays (sequences):** If a top-level key expects an array, the entire array defined in the last processed configuration will completely replace any previously defined arrays for that key. There is no element-by-element merging; it's a full overwrite.
* **Objects (hashes/mappings):** If a top-level key holds an object (a collection of key-value pairs), GitLab performs a **deep merge**. This means:
    * Unique properties within the object from all sources are combined.
    * If the same property exists in multiple objects, the value from the last processed object will override previous values for that specific property.
    * This deep merge applies recursively to nested objects.

Understanding this fundamental rule is key to predicting the final pipeline configuration when combining multiple CI/CD files.

Here's a breakdown of the merge rules for all relevant top-level keywords:

### `include`
The `include` keyword itself dictates the order of processing. When multiple `include` sections are present, all specified files are loaded and evaluated in the order they appear. The merging then occurs based on the content of these included files and the main `.gitlab-ci.yml` file, applying the "Last-In Wins" principle to their respective top-level keywords and their contents. It's not about merging the `include` arrays themselves, but rather about the cascading effect of their contents.

### `stages`
When multiple `.gitlab-ci.yml` files define the `stages` keyword, the last defined `stages` array in the order of inclusion will **completely override** any previously defined `stages` arrays. This is an **Array Overwrite**, meaning only the stages from the last included file will be active in the final merged pipeline.

### `variables`
For the `variables` keyword, the merge behavior is an **Object Deep Merge with Last-In Precedence**. If the same variable is defined in multiple files, the value from the last included file will take precedence. If a variable is only defined in one of the included files, it will be included in the final set of variables.

### `default`
The `default` keyword undergoes an **Object Deep Merge with Last-In Precedence**. All its nested properties (like `image`, `before_script`, `after_script`, `retry`, `tags`, `cache`, `artifacts`, etc.) are merged recursively. If a specific property within `default` is defined in multiple files, the last definition encountered will override previous ones for that specific property. Other properties that are not redefined will be retained from earlier definitions.

### `workflow`
If the `workflow` keyword is defined in multiple included files, the last defined `workflow` object will **completely override** any previous `workflow` definitions. This is an **Object Overwrite**, meaning only the rules and behavior from the last `workflow` block will be applied to the pipeline.

### `image`
When `image` is defined at the top-level (globally), it acts as a property within the overall configuration. If multiple includes define a top-level `image`, the last one in the inclusion order will act as a **Scalar/Object Overwrite**, completely replacing any previous global `image` definitions, whether it's a simple string or a more complex object.

### `services`
When defined at the top-level, `services` is treated as an array of service definitions. If `services` is defined in multiple includes, the **entire array of service definitions from the last included file will completely override** any previously defined global `services` arrays. This is an **Array Overwrite**.

### `before_script`
When defined at the top-level, `before_script` represents a global script to run before all jobs. If defined in multiple includes, the **entire array of commands for `before_script` from the last included file will completely overwrite** any previously defined global `before_script` arrays. This is an **Array Overwrite**.

### `after_script`
Similar to `before_script`, when `after_script` is defined at the top-level, the **entire array of commands from the last included file will completely overwrite** any previously defined global `after_script` arrays. This is an **Array Overwrite**.

### `cache`
When defined at the top-level as a global default, `cache` undergoes an **Object Deep Merge with Last-In Precedence**. Individual properties within `cache` (like `key`, `paths`, `policy`) will be merged recursively. If a specific property is defined in multiple files, the last definition for that property takes precedence.

### `artifacts`
When defined at the top-level as a global default, `artifacts` also undergoes an **Object Deep Merge with Last-In Precedence**. Its nested properties (like `paths`, `expire_in`, `when`) will be merged recursively, with the last definition for a specific property taking precedence.

### Jobs (e.g., `build_job`, `test_job`, `deploy_job`, `pages`, etc.)
Jobs defined in different included files are merged with an **Additive Combination with Last-In Overwrite for Conflicting Names**. All uniquely named jobs from all configurations will be present in the final pipeline. However, if two configurations define jobs with the **exact same name**, the job defined in the last processed configuration will **completely override** the one defined earlier.

Furthermore, properties *within* each individual job (e.g., `script`, `image`, `rules`, `only`, `except`, `dependencies`, `needs`, `timeout`, `retry`, etc.) follow an **Object Deep Merge with Last-In Precedence** logic. This means specific job properties are overridden by the last definition, while unique properties are retained from earlier definitions.
