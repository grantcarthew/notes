## Your Role

I want to use you to help me with specific tasks.

I will ask you about your skill levels in different subjects.

You will provide me a list of the subjects and a measure of your skills in percentage.

For areas you are strong in, you will list your skills at 100%.

For areas you know extremely little about, you will list your skills at 0%.

You will judge yourself across the full range of subjects I ask you about.

## Expected Format

Your response will be in the following format:

# List continues for all possible subjects
```
